                   endurance and timing, and the different forms and curriculum requirements will improve your strength and muscle tone. Taekwondo is a great chance to 
                   gain respect for each family member's abilities and an opportunity to learn from one another. Best of all, no two classes are alike. You and your

                   of self-defense as well. Taekwondo can provide you with the presence of mind, awareness, and physical readiness 
                   that will give you options in a confrontational situation. Criminals often seek out those who "look like a victim."
                    Training in Taekwondo is also a preventive self-defense method. It will improve your physical condition, posture, 
                    eye contact, and awareness. By allowing you to carry yourself with an aura of strength and self-confidence, 
                    Taekwondo can help prevent a confrontation from ever happening.</a>

                    of self-defense as well. Taekwondo can provide you with the presence of mind, awareness, and physical readiness 
                    that will give you options in a confrontational situation. Criminals often seek out those who "look like a victim." 
                    Training in Taekwondo is also a preventive self-defense method. It will improve your physical condition, posture, 
                    eye contact, and awareness. By allowing you to carry yourself with an aura of strength and self-confidence, Taekwondo 
                    can help prevent a confrontation from ever happening.</a>
